# SportyBet_OddPickingBot
The objective of this Selenium automation project is to create a bot that efficiently selects a maximum of five games from the SportyBet bookmaker. The selection process focuses on identifying games with odds that are less than 1.2. By utilizing Selenium, the project automates the tedious task of manually browsing through numerous games and their corresponding odds. 

Games with lower odds indicate a higher likelihood of winning according to the bookmaker's assessment. Focusing on such games increases the chances of successful outcomes.
